Hi there :smile:

I'm a Co-founder & CTO at [MOVIN](https://www.movin3d.com). Before that, I was a Postdoc in [Motion Computing Lab](https://lava.kaist.ac.kr) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) and interned at Meta Reality Labs.

My research goal is to improve the quality of digital character motion in computer graphics and AR/VR systems using deep learning methods. 
I currently focus on the 3D full-body markerless motion capture in real-time.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Graphics, from the KAIST, where I also completed my M.S. advised by Prof. [Sung-Hee Lee](https://lava.kaist.ac.kr/?page_id=41). I acquired a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics, from KAIST.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
